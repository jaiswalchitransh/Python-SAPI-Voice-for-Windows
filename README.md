# Python-SAPI-Voice-for-Windows

This Python script utilizes the win32com library to access the Windows Speech API (SAPI) for text-to-speech functionality. It prompts the user to input words or phrases to be spoken aloud, continuously looping until the user enters "-1" to terminate the program. Upon receiving user input, it speaks the inputted text using the default text-to-speech engine provided by Windows, facilitating an interactive text-to-speech experience directly within the console environment.
