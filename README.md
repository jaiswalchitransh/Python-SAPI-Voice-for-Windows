## Project Overview
This Python script utilizes the win32com library to access the Windows Speech API (SAPI) for text-to-speech functionality. It prompts the user to input words or phrases to be spoken aloud, continuously looping until the user enters "-1" to terminate the program. Upon receiving user input, it speaks the inputted text using the default text-to-speech engine provided by Windows, facilitating an interactive text-to-speech experience directly within the console environment.


## Installation
This project requires Python 3.12.1 or later.
To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python 3.12.1 or a later version is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
      - git clone <https://github.com/jaiswalchitransh/Python-SAPI-Voice-for-Windows>
4. Open the project in your preferred Python environment (e.g., IDE or terminal).
5. Run the script (`speaks.py`) and observe the output.


## Usage
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Run the script:

- python speaks.py
  
- Enter words or phrases when prompted. Each input will be spoken aloud immediately.
- To stop the program, type "-1" and press Enter.


## Features
- **Text-to-Speech**: Utilizes the Windows Speech API (SAPI) for converting text input to spoken output.
- **Interactive**: Allows continuous input and speech output until terminated by the user.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides a simple interface within the console environment for speech synthesis.
